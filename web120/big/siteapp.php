 <h2 class="pageID">Websites vs Applications</h2>
    <h3><strong>Features of Responsive Websites</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A responsive site has a special design based on CSS media queries. It allows website’s content to fit into any type of screen both 17’ laptop or 3’ phone.</li>
        <li>Those queries nonetheless have few imperfections: not only they require more developer’s work and attention but also such website most probably would download slower</li>
        <li>Adaptive websites are different than responsive</li>
        <li>When people look for information, they don’t go to the app stores at once. It is more likely that they will start with web browsers</li>
        <li>Google likes mobile/friendly websites and gives them better SERP ranking as a reward</li>
        <li>A mobile website is available for all users. It doesn’t require downloading or installation. In addition, most of the sites are free. Regardless of operating system, you can easily use a responsive website on your smartphone.</li>
        <li>The site is easy for updating, supporting and bug fixing. Users can simply enjoy the renewed product as it updates.</li>
        <li>The mobile website is less expensive.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><strong>Why Choose the Mobile App</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Mobile apps work differently than responsive websites. They don’t run on all devices and need to be installed separately but what they give is unique user experience</li>
        <li>While your website is aimed at attracting new or occasional clients your mobile app works with regular clients.</li>
        <li>A mobile app is notably good when a person needs to complete some goal. The well-designed app must give your client all opportunities to perform it just in few taps or scrolls.</li>
        <li>push notifications!</li>
        <li>expenses are much higher as far as you need to create separate apps for different operating systems. Primarily you must think about iOS and Android. The first one brings better revenue while the second one shows better results in a total number of downloads.</li>
        <li>they can require access to your personal information or third party services. At the same time apps can guarantee bigger safety than browsers.</li>
        <li>Apps can work offline.</li>
        <li>When it comes to design displaying — mobile app tends to be more resistant to the variety of screen sizes that might appear on the various phones and tablets. Also, design for a mobile app is typically more holistic and user-friendly as it is done for a specific platform. Pictures usually upload faster and the app itself uses less mobile data.</li>
        <li>Mobile app works better with hardware sensors like microphone, camera, GPS, etc., that improves acting with a device and makes user’s life easier. So that you can get access to different phone options like calls or geolocation just with a few taps.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Responsive mobile design generally means that your site is designed specifically for mobile use. It will often be housed under a different URL (usually something like m.yoursite.com) and will feature subsets of your desktop content that are appropriate for mobile viewing. These pages will adapt to whatever screen size the user desires.</p>
    <p>Mobile apps, on the other hand, are specific applications customized to each Operating System (OS) that feature unique designs and codebases. In our mobile-crazed world, native mobile apps are becoming a popular choice for many sites that want to offer users a top-shelf experience.</p>
    <h3><strong>Pros of Responsive Web Design</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Time: </strong>Launching a mobile site is a faster process than designing an application.</li>
        <li><strong>Cost: </strong>Responsive web design is comparatively cheap when measured against the costs of designing a native mobile app from the ground up.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><strong>Cons of Responsive Web Design</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>aren’t as fast or as functional as native mobile apps.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><strong>Pros of Mobile Apps</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Functionality: </strong>Apps feature greater functionality than mobile-oriented sites can allow due to the way each is custom built into the device’s OS</li>
        <li><strong>Speed: </strong>Mobile apps are designed top to bottom with efficiency in mind</li>
        <li><strong>Brand Recognition: </strong>Nothing beats a native app for brand awareness and marketing. With handy desktop shortcuts, mobile apps put you front and center on each user’s phone, and the custom code used to create apps can relay information back to businesses about user behaviors to inform future development decisions.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><strong>Cons of Mobile Apps</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Building an application requires a different set of skills than modifying a site for mobile. When done poorly, the great brand awareness present in native apps can work against businesses: If consumers see a shoddy app, it makes the business seem amateur.</li>
        <li>These are the two drawbacks of native app development: Investing the time and investing the money.</li>
    </ul>
